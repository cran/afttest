Description: A collection of model checking methods for semiparametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models under the rank-based approach. For the (computational) efficiency, Gehan's weight is used. It provides functions to verify whether the observed data fit the specific model assumptions such as a functional form of each covariate, a link function, and an omnibus test. The p-value offered in this package is based on the Kolmogorov-type supremum test and the variance of the proposed test statistics is estimated through the re-sampling method. Furthermore, a graphical technique to compare the shape of the observed residual to a number of the approximated realizations is provided.
